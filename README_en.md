| What is the importance of static electricity knowledge in tanker transportation and how to deal with it?               | Static electricity is a very important issue in tanker transportation because tankers generate a lot of static electricity when loading and unloading oil. Static electricity can cause fires and explosions, so appropriate measures must be taken to prevent the generation and accumulation of static electricity. \n\nThe following are some of the common ways in which static electricity is generated and accumulated: \n\n1. friction and collision of oil during loading and unloading. \n\n2. flow of oil in pipelines and tanks. \n\n3. the flow of oil in the tanker's bilge. \n\n4. metallic structures and other electrically conductive materials in the tanker's hold. \n\nThe following are some countermeasures: \n\n1. use of anti-static materials and equipment such as anti-static floors, anti-static mats, anti-static gloves, anti-static clothing, etc. \n\n2. use anti-static grounding devices to conduct static electricity to the ground when loading and unloading oil. \n\n3. installing anti-static devices such as anti-static tanks, anti-static pumps, etc., in the tanker holds \n\n4. installing anti-static coatings in tanker holds, e.g. anti-static coatings, anti-static paints, anti-static coatings, etc. \n\n5. Installation of anti-static piping and tanks in the tanker's hold to minimize the accumulation of static electricity. \n\n6. installing anti-static equipment such as anti-static pumps, anti-static valves, etc. in the tanker's hold to minimize the generation of static electricity. \n\n7. install anti-static grounding devices in the tanker cabins to channel static electricity to the ground. \n\nSummary, static electricity is a very important issue in tanker transportation, and appropriate measures must be taken to prevent the generation and accumulation of static electricity. |
| How to use radar correctly for collision avoidance?                                   | Radar is a very important navigational tool on board a ship to help the crew identify other ships, obstacles and dangerous areas. When navigating at sea, it is very important to use radar correctly for collision avoidance. Here are some tips for using radar for collision avoidance:\n\n1. Set the proper radar range: the radar range should be set according to the size of the ship and its surroundings. If the ship is too small, the radar range should be set to a smaller range to minimize interference and errors. \n\n2. monitor the radar screen: during the voyage, the crew should always monitor the radar screen to stay alert. If other vessels or obstacles are detected, immediate action should be taken. \n\n3. recognizing targets: on the radar screen, the crew should be able to recognize other vessels or obstacles. This can be done by observing the echoes on the radar screen. If the target is too far away, the crew should try to increase the radar range to better identify the target. \n\n4. Calculating Distance and Speed: The crew should be able to calculate the distance and speed of other vessels or obstacles from themselves. This can be done by looking at the distance and speed information on the radar screen. \n\n5. take action: if another vessel or obstacle is sighted, the crew should take immediate action. This may include changing course, speed or distance from the target. The crew should always be alert and ready to take action. \n\n In conclusion, the proper use of radar for collision avoidance requires good observation and judgment on the part of the crew. The crew should always be alert and ready to act at all times. |
| What is a VTS (Vessel Traffic Service) system and what is its role in maritime safety? | A VTS (Vessel Traffic Service) system is a system used to monitor and manage vessel traffic. It uses radar, IS (Automatic Identification System) and other sensors to track information such as a ship's position, heading and speed, and to provide real-time ship traffic information and advice.VTS systems can help ships to avoid collisions, optimize the flow of ship traffic, improve ship safety and reduce emissions. In addition, VTS systems can provide assistance and rescue services in emergency situations. |


## Model evaluation ##

In order to more comprehensively compare the performance difference between the Zhenghe Maritime Large Language Model (Zh-MT-LLM) and the General Domain Large Language Model within the maritime domain. We constructed two evaluation datasets, Zh-eval-opt and Zh-eval-qa, from two perspectives, objective and subjective questions.

### Objective question evaluation

The Zh-eval-opt objective question assessment dataset contains 800 multiple choice questions. The questions cover as wide a range of specialties in the maritime field as possible, and also include questions related to crew training. We use Accuracy to compare the performance of the model on this dataset.

#### Evaluation Results

## Training data

The training data use the maritime domain data Zh-mt-sft organized for three main segments, and 30w general conversation data [moss-003-sft-data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fnlp/moss-003-sft-data). Zh-mt-sft specifically Contains CrimeKgAssitant-1.8w, Zh-law-qa, and Zh-law-court related to maritime laws and regulations Q&A, Zh-edu-qa and Zh-edu-qb related to maritime education and training, and Zh-mt-qa related to maritime specialized knowledge Q&A.

The instruction fine-tuning dataset Zh-mt-sft is constructed as follows:

#### Maritime Laws and Regulations Q&A

The Maritime Laws and Regulations Q&A section contains a total of three services:

- Consultation on Maritime Laws and Regulations
- The Court consider
- Judgement prediction

In order to provide consulting services on the laws and regulations that characterize the maritime domain, this project collected a total of **1.4w** maritime-related laws and regulations, covering international conventions, maritime laws, documents of the State Council, documents of ministries and commissions, administrative regulations, documents of the Maritime Safety Administration, and documents of judicial interpretations, and so on. Based on the information collected above, we designed and iterated the prompt words, and generated a total of **5.9w** maritime laws and regulations advisory data using **GPT-3.5-Turbo **. From these, we extracted **1.3k** pieces of legal advice data involving maritime law, which were rewritten by maritime law professionals to align human preferences while enhancing the professionalism of the responses. In addition, we cleaned and filtered **1.8w** pieces of higher quality data from the **CrimeKgAssitant** dataset of legal advice in real-world scenarios to increase the generalizability of legal advice.

The court opinion and judgment prediction part totaled **5.6k** pieces of data, collected from real judicial cases related to maritime affairs in the NLM website. The case information description part is intercepted as the input, and the content of court opinion and court judgment are used as the output of the two operations respectively.

#### Maritime Education and Training

Maritime education and training consists of two major services:

- Maritime Specialty Question Bank
- Maritime Education Counseling

Maritime professional question bank collected from the network as well as the school of all kinds of maritime-related professional question bank, which contains a part of the online collection of crew certification related test questions, a total of **2.3w** articles.

The Maritime Education Consultancy Service provides specialized knowledge-related educational consultancy services for various types of trainers in the maritime field and maritime students. The data comes from three parts: in the first part, we collected the examination syllabi for trainers in the maritime field, such as the Examination Syllabus for Seafarers and the Examination Syllabus for Persons Engaged in the Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Vessel in and out of Ports and Declarations. Based on the knowledge points in the syllabus, we designed and iterated the cue words and generated **2.2w** pieces of data using GPT-3.5-Turbo. In the second part, we collected a total of **1k** pieces of high-quality crew general knowledge quiz data from the Internet. In the third part, we reconstructed the Q&A using GPT-3.5-Turbo for a part of the questions in the question bank that involved specialized knowledge according to the following principles:

- Responses should continue to be fleshed out based on the content of the answer options.
- Rewritten questions need to relate to the correct answer for that topic.
- No description of the original multiple choice/judgment question type can appear in the question, or in the response.

In the end, we filtered out **1.6w** of these high-quality data to add maritime domain expertise to the consultation data.

#### Maritime Expertise Q&A

For this part of the data we first designed and iterated the cue words using two methods to obtain the data, one in the form of GPT-3.5-Turbo self-questioning and one in the form of GPT-3.5-Turbo asking questions that GPT-4.0-Turbo answers. For the **7.2w** pieces of data generated through the above two methods, we retained **4.6w** pieces of high-quality data for fine-tuning after cleaning and filtering.

The specific statistics of the dataset used for the above training are as follows:

## Declaration

Due to factors such as the limitation of the number of model parameters and the degree of cleaning of the training data, the model open source in this project may have the following limitations:

- Because it has not been harmlessly fine-tuned, it may result in discriminatory, harmful and unethical statements.
- Lacking an accurate understanding of the real world, the model may produce hallucinatory responses that mislead the user.
- The model's training data may contain biased data, and users should be cautious about potential bias in model responses.

- Due to the limited number of model parameters, it may not be possible to cover all areas of knowledge, resulting in less accurate or complete responses on some topics.

- When dealing with factual knowledge in a specific domain, models may provide incorrect answers due to insufficient information or misinterpretation, leading to misinformation or confusion.

Given the limitations of the above model, we request that the code, data, and model of this project not be used for socially harmful purposes and must follow the [MODEL_LICENCE](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM3/blob/main/MODEL_LICENSE) of the base model. We are not responsible for any problems, risks, or adverse consequences arising from the use of Zh-MT-LLM.
